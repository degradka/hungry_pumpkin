## Overview

This project is a labor of love, aiming to preserve life of the original game.

## About

### Inspiration
The original "Hungry Pumpkin" game, I believe it is from 2005-2007, brought joy to many. Unfortunately, it now rests in the digital archives. This project seeks to pay homage and keep the game alive.

### Authorship
While the original author remains elusive, credit is attributed to Pumpkin Productions, the alleged company behind the game. I tried to recreate every feature and sprite to faithfully capture the essence of the original.
